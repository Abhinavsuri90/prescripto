## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Port Already in Use**: 
   - Make sure no other services are running on ports 4000, 5173, or 5174
   
2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**: 
   - Verify your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
   
3. **Module Not Found**: 
   - Run `npm install` in each directory (backend, frontend, admin)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Start all three servers (backend, frontend, admin)
2. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
3. Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:5174`
4. Log in to the admin panel using the credentials above
5. Start adding doctors and managing appointments!

## 💡 Development Tips
